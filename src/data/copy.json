I came from a fertile group of women: My paternal grandmother had 13 children and my mother’s mom had 6."},{"type":"text","value":"But alas, I was not able to become pregnant after months of trying, and my doctor sent me on the route of IVF."}]},{"id":"heartbreak","text":[{"type":"text","value":"IVF is an obstacle course of logistics that you have to overcome while living your day-to-day life."},{"type":"text","value":"For the past two years, IVF has tested my physical and emotional stamina. It has drained my savings. And I’ve been heartbroken again and again."}]},{"id":"quest","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Many women who’ve done IVF call themselves warriors."},{"type":"text","value":"And I can see why: This whole journey has felt like a quest during which I’ve had to put on a brave face as I took on one challenge after another."}]},{"id":"needles","text":[{"type":"text","value":"First, the five egg retrievals."},{"type":"text","value":"To try and produce as many eggs as my body could muster, I became a science experiment: I injected a cocktail of hormones into my body, gave my doctor a blood sample every other day, and had an ultrasound technician monitor my ovaries."}]},{"id":"more-needles","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Over the course of five retrievals, I stabbed myself with 166 syringes. My veins were poked 82 times for blood samples. And because I wanted to improve my odds, I went to 31 acupuncture appointments, where 669 needles pierced my underbelly, legs and head."}]},{"id":"logistics","text":"Each cycle was also a test of my ability to handle logistics. There were the 7am doctor’s appointments before work; the dozens of days working from home to receive all my medications; and the many times I reshuffled my travel plans. I’ve become a master of schedule Tetris."},{"id":"adversaries","text":[{"type":"text","value":"There are adversaries, too: the insurance agent who wrongfully denied my claim; the person from the finance department who overcharged me multiple times; and the administrator who wanted $50 to release my health records."}]},{"id":"go-wrong","text":[{"type":"text","value":"There’s also so much that can go wrong."},{"type":"text","value":"One time, my fertility clinic did not send in my prescription on time. I had to call the pharmacy 32 times to get my medication approved."}]},{"id":"wrong-clinic","text":"Another time, I was sent to the wrong clinic for an appointment."},{"id":"owe-money","text":[{"type":"text","value":"And yet another time, I received a text message that falsely claimed I had $10,000 in medical debt. All this, while I was still sobbing over a failed IVF cycle."}]},{"id":"sanity","text":"I’ve persevered for so long, spent so much money, arrived at every appointment on time."},{"id":"hoops","text":[{"type":"text","value":"And even after I did everything right, I was still foiled by bad luck."},{"type":"text","value":"The majority of my embryos were abnormal. And both of the embryos I was able to transfer into my uterus failed to implant."}]},{"id":"help","text":[{"type":"text","value":"I have had small wins that kept me going and I’ve lost big when I felt I was close to the goal."},{"type":"text","value":"Sometimes it feels like I’m stuck, while the world keeps moving on. Six friends have gotten pregnant since I started this journey — two of them through IVF."}]},{"id":"strength","text":"But I’ve also met so many people on my quest who’ve pushed ahead for me when I couldn’t muster the strength."},{"id":"simone","text":"There is Simone, a friend and fellow IVF warrior, who shared so many little crucial tips and helped me keep going."},{"id":"friends","text":"There are my other fellow warriors: a friend and her wife who conceived their daughter through IVF; a friend’s wife who sent me a gift during a tender time; a friend who’s freezing her eggs to preserve her fertility. We walked alongside one another."},{"id":"online","text":"There are the many women on Reddit, on Facebook and in Google Groups, who encourage each other, share knowledge, and console one another."},{"id":"warriors","text":[{"type":"text","value":"I've built my own little band of warriors. We cheer each other on. It's a shitty club none of us want to be part of, but one that is full of the best people."}]},{"id":"end","text":"This can feel like a lonely journey. But when I look around, I know my village and I are ready to meet my child when the time comes."}],"baby":[{"id":"ivf","text":[{"type":"text","value":"This is the story about how science can increase the odds of creating a baby for  women like me who struggle with infertility."},{"type":"text","value":"It follows the journey of one follicle that became an egg, then an embryo and eventually a baby in my uterus."}]},{"id":"follicles","text":"Our little follicle was one of many follicles that my ovaries produced. Every month, one of those many follicles houses and nourishes an egg until it is ready to be released."},{"id":"inefficient","text":"The odds of that one lonely egg becoming a healthy baby were quite slim, especially given I was in my late 30s. The eggs I produced each month did not end up in a pregnancy, as much as my husband and I tried. My body needed help."},{"id":"egg","text":"That’s where IVF came into the picture. Through this medical process, my doctors helped more of my follicles release mature eggs. The more eggs, the better the odds."},{"id":"hormones","text":"During my first round of IVF, I started with 8 follicles. After 14 days of hormonal injections, most of those follicles produced eggs."},{"id":"first-cycle","text":"7 of those eggs were mature enough to be retrieved by my doctor."},{"id":"fertilize","text":"And, 6 of those eggs were successfully fertilized by an embryologist."},{"id":"viable","text":"Over 5 days, the embryologist watched those  embryos grow into a more mature stage called blastocyst. Not all of them made it and in the end only 3 embryos remained."},{"id":"genetic-testing","text":[{"type":"text","value":"Then another crucial hurdle: genetic testing. All my doctors strongly believe in testing embryos for women like me, who are older than 35."},{"type":"text","value":"After an agonizingly long 21-day wait, our doctor informed us that all 3 embryos were abnormal and would likely lead to miscarriages if implanted."}]},{"id":"lottery","text":"IVF can feel like a cruel lottery system in this way, but one that is drawn out over weeks. Each cycle takes about 40 days from start to finish before you know if you have an embryo that could be implanted."},{"id":"perservere","text":[{"type":"text","value":"I ended up doing a total of 5 cycles during which I produced 57 eggs. 21 of them turned into blastocyst embryos. And of those 21 only 4 were suitable for transfer."}]},{"id":"transfer","text":[{"type":"text","value":"When it was finally time to transfer an embryo into my uterus, I did multiple tests to prepare."},{"type":"text","value":"I seemed to have a healthy uterus. But alas — the embryo did not implant and neither did the next one. I discovered I had endometriosis and the next embryo’s implantation was delayed."}]},{"id":"journey","text":[{"type":"text","value":"It’s hurdles like these — the abnormal embryos, the failed implantations — that present new challenges and problems to solve for the many people who are trying to help our little egg  make it to birth."},{"type":"text","value":"Yes, there are the doctors, nurses, sonographers and other clinical staffers who are helping as much as they can."},{"type":"text","value":"But there are also others who try to help the egg."}]},{"id":"nutritionist","text":"There was the nutritionist who gave me instructions on what to eat to make a healthy embryo."},{"id":"doula","text":"There was the fertility doula who helped me interpret each result, who found me a better clinic, and who helped me save thousands of dollars by fighting finance departments with me."},{"id":"acupuncturists","text":"There are the acupuncturists who channeled a lot of medicinal wisdom from East Asia and adjusted their treatment to each phase of my journey."},{"id":"microbiologist","text":"And then there was the microbiologist who wrote a whole book in which she laid out what supplements and foods may be helpful."},{"id":"finally","text":"It took all these people, medical treatments for endometriosis and TK more transfers before I finally got pregnant."},{"id":"end","text":"This can feel like a lonely journey. But when I look around, I know my village and I are ready to meet my child when the time comes."}]}}
