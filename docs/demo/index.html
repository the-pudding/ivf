My paternal grandmother had 13 children. My mother’s mom had 6. I came from a fertile group of women. But alas, I was not able to become pregnant after 12 months of trying and was sent on the route of IVF."},{"type":"text","value":"In vitro fertilization, which is more commonly known as IVF, is an obstacle course of logistics, a test of your physical and emotional stamina, and a drain on your savings. Many folks compare women who go through IVF to warriors."},{"type":"text","value":"That’s likely because doing IVF can feel like a quest with a series of challenges."},{"type":"text","value":"First there’s the egg retrieval and making of embryos. Your body must withstand an ungodly amount of needles for this process. There are the daily hormonal injections, first 2 and then 3 needles a day."},{"type":"text","value":"In between there are the doctor’s appointments, which includes another needle to draw blood every 2-3 days, and the weekly fertility acupuncture sessions."},{"type":"text","value":"Throughout all of this you have to solve a jigsaw puzzle that is your schedule."},{"type":"text","value":"You have to take on giant healthcare bureaucrats — many who want to deny your claims and support staff that confuse your case."},{"type":"text","value":"One time, our fertility clinic did not send in our prescription on time, and I had to travel across the city to pick up medications a friend had left over from her cycle."},{"type":"text","value":"Another time, I was sent to the wrong clinic for an appointment."},{"type":"text","value":"And yet another, I received an automated text message from the fertility clinic falsely stating that I owed more than $10,000 while I was in the middle of sobbing over some other bad test results."},{"type":"text","value":"You lose resources — money, time and sanity."},{"type":"text","value":"And still, if you’ve braved all the hoops and hurdles there’s an element of sheer luck that might foil you."},{"type":"text","value":"And through it all you have to keep on hope, you have to do research to find other doctors who are able to help. And you have to keep believing that in the"},{"type":"text","value":"Like with any quest, you meet people along the way. You bond with many who give you strength."},{"type":"text","value":"IVF feels like a journey that is marred with complicated feelings. You feel shame because your body is not doing what it is “supposed to do.” During the process, you feel like cattle being moved through a terrible factory, constantly reacting to forces that are out of your control. And above all, you feel lonely in your journey because it can seem like a taboo subject. But when I opened up, I found many people from all walks of life and all experiences to support me."},{"type":"text","value":"There was Simone, a close friend who went through IVF right before I started my journey and who asked me for updates on major milestones during my journey."},{"type":"text","value":"There were my friends whom I bumped into at the clinic and those who told me they were doing egg retrievals or IVF after I mentioned my own fertility struggles. We would walk alongside one another for part of each other’s journeys and even when our paths diverged, we’d still check in."},{"type":"text","value":"And then were the many women online. During moments of crippling anxiety and late night Google searches, I found similar solidarity in the countless women who had posted on Reddit forums or on Facebook."},{"type":"text","value":"Their collective encouragement felt a bit like a crowd on the sidelines, cheering me on during a marathon."},{"type":"text","value":"You can’t do all this alone and everyone is so excited for you to meet your baby."}],"baby":[{"type":"text","value":"This is the story of the egg that became my baby during the process of IVF. It’s the story of Lam’s little egg that eventually became her baby Ruby."},{"type":"text","value":"In vitro fertilization, which is more commonly known as IVF, is the process of using a lot of science to help our natural human reproductive system with creating a baby."},{"type":"text","value":"It starts a bundle of follicles, each representing a chance for a baby."},{"type":"text","value":"The odds for a follicle to grow into a mature egg, to become a healthy embryo and to grow into a healthy baby are quite slim. As some doctors put it, human reproduction is terribly inefficient, despite so many medical advances."},{"type":"text","value":"Every month, women have multiple follicles of which one matures into an egg each month."},{"type":"text","value":"During IVF, doctors stimulate those follicles with hormones to encourage every follicle to become a mature egg and eventually a healthy embryo. But during each step we lose a few potential embryos."},{"type":"text","value":"During my first cycle, I started with 8 follicles. Then came the 14 days of hormonal injections that helped those 8 follicles grow. 7 of those original follicles became eggs and were retrieved by the doctors."},{"type":"text","value":"Of those eggs, embryologists were able to fertilize 6."},{"type":"text","value":"Then after 5 days of waiting, only 3 embryos remained viable."},{"type":"text","value":"Then another crucial hurdle: genetic testing, which the doctors recommended for women like me who are above the age of 35. A laboratory analyzed samples of all three of our embryos. After 21 days, they informed us that all 3 of them were abnormal and would likely lead to miscarriages."},{"type":"text","value":"IVF can feel like a cruel lottery system in this way. And what makes the whole cycle rougher is that each cycle takes roughly 40 days from start to finish before you know if an embryo could even have the chance of being implanted."},{"type":"text","value":"But if you have the wherewithal, and if your insurance covers more than one round, like mine did, you can persevere. I ended up doing three more cycles like this and only after the third cycle did two little embryos finally test normal. After a fourth retrieval, we finally had 4 embryos, each representing a 50-60% of a live birth."},{"type":"text","value":"After this step, it was finally time for an embryo transfer from a test tube into my uterus. The doctor’s deemed the healthiest was transferred into the womb. And despite the best of odds — a healthy uterus and good diagnostic tests — the embryo did not implant."},{"type":"text","value":"Like with any other scientific process there are many additional variables you could introduce to potentially help your outcome."},{"type":"text","value":"It’s not just the doctors and nurses who are helping our lucky little egg along the way. There are also a lot of other people who have different approaches to fertility. Each represents a different school of thought and people don’t always put credence in each of these parts, but it’s remarkable just how many folks may be part of your egg’s journey."},{"type":"text","value":"There was the nutritionist who forwarded me instructions on what to eat to help the egg"},{"type":"text","value":"There was the fertility doula who helped me interpret each result, who found me a better clinic that ultimately got me on a hormonal protocol that yielded much better results."},{"type":"text","value":"There are the acupuncturists who channeled a lot of ancient medicinal wisdom from East Asia and adjusted my treatment to each phase of my journey."},{"type":"text","value":"And then there was the microbiologist who wrote a whole book in which she laid out what supplements may be helpful."},{"type":"text","value":"You can’t do all this alone and everyone is so excited for you to meet your baby."}]}</pre></code> <!--[--><!--]--><!----></section><!----> <div class="c"><h2>Load Data</h2> <div class="response"><!--[--><p>loading data...</p><!--]--></div></div><!----> <section id="scrolly"><h2 class="svelte-12sq0x6">Scrolly <span>-</span></h2> <div class="spacer svelte-12sq0x6"></div> <div><!--[--><div class="step svelte-12sq0x6"><p class="svelte-12sq0x6">0</p></div><div class="step svelte-12sq0x6"><p class="svelte-12sq0x6">1</p></div><div class="step svelte-12sq0x6"><p class="svelte-12sq0x6">2</p></div><div class="step svelte-12sq0x6"><p class="svelte-12sq0x6">3</p></div><div class="step svelte-12sq0x6"><p class="svelte-12sq0x6">4</p></div><!--]--><!----></div><!----> <div class="spacer svelte-12sq0x6"></div></section><!----></div><!----><!----></main><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
